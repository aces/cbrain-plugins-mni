<h1>Task options for NuCorrect</h1>

<p>
This document is, temporarily, just a copy of the raw
nu_correct tool's help output. A better explanation
will be provided later.

Summary of options:

-- General options -------------------------------------------------------------
   -verbose          be noisy [default; opposite is -quiet]
   -quiet            opposite of -verbose
   -execute          actually execute planned commands [default]
   -noexecute        opposite of -execute
   -clobber          overwrite output files [default: -noclobber]
   -noclobber        opposite of -clobber
   -tmpdir           temporary working directory [default:
                     /usr/tmp/nu_correct_29184/]
   -keeptmp          don't delete temporary files [default: -nokeeptmp]
   -nokeeptmp        opposite of -keeptmp
   -version          print version and quit

-- Protocol options ------------------------------------------------------------
   -mask &lt;mask.mnc&gt;  specify region for processing
   -distance &lt;value&gt; characteristic distance over which field varies in mm
                     (default 200) [default: 200]
   -iterations &lt;number&gt;
                     maximum number of iterations to run
   -options options ...
                     method specific options (quoted if more than one)
                     [default: ""]
   -mapping_dir &lt;directory&gt;
                     specifiy directory to put imp files in

-- N3 specific options ---------------------------------------------------------
   -stop &lt;threshold&gt; CV of change in field estimate below which iteration
                     stops (suggest 0.01 to 0.0001)
   -shrink &lt;factor&gt;  specify a smaller workspace; the sampling in each
                     dimension is reduced to that of the finest sampling
                     divided by factor or the current sampling which ever is
                     less. (suggest 2 or 3)
   -normalize_field  normalize final correction field to have mean 1.0
   -V0.9             use default options of original (beta) release
   -V1.0             use improved options of release 1.0.  This is equivalent
                     to -fwhm 0.15 -stop 0.001 -iterations 50 -shrink 4
                     -distance 200.  (default)
   -fwhm &lt;width&gt;     width of deconvolution kernal used to sharpen histogram.
                     Larger values give faster convergence while smaller
                     values give greater accuracy.  (suggest 0.05 to 0.5,
                     default is 0.15) [default: 0.15]
